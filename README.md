# Automated Web-Based System for Course and Program Outcome Tracking and Analysis

## Overview
This project addresses inefficiencies in traditional Excel-based workflows used for tracking Course Outcomes (COs), Program Outcomes (POs), and Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs). Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the system streamlines academic outcome tracking for educational institutions by providing real-time analytics, automated attainment calculations, and structured role-based workflows.

## Features
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, HOD, Course Coordinator, and Faculty roles with tailored permissions.
- **Automated Analytics**: Calculates attainment levels using weighted inputs (CIE, SEE, and feedback).
- **Excel Integration**: Bulk uploads for marks, feedback, and profiles using standardized templates.
- **Visual Dashboards**: Interactive analytics on CO/PO gaps, attainment levels, and action plans.
- **Feedback Integration**: Includes student feedback in indirect attainment metrics.
- **Root Cause Analysis & Action Planning**: Enables proactive curriculum adjustments.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based token system
- **Deployment Target**: AWS EC2 (t3.medium recommended)

## Future Enhancements
- UI improvements with guided upload formats and better visual cues.
- Backend optimization for scalability and concurrent user support.
